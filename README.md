# Godot Movement Scripts
This is a collection of all the scripts I use for my games. This can include framework, delta speed arrangements, instancing, and more. If you would like to use any of these scripts, please contact me on discord at kanteer#4923.

These scripts are still a work in progress, as I am still learning GDScript.
